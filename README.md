# jsast

a simple javascript parser, run in node env

## project

when using some parser like: uglify-js or esprima, they do not take care of comments in code
so i need a parser which treat comments as js code, and parse them into ast.

meanwhile, es6 is comming, while the uglify-js seams stop upgrading.
